Crowd Sourced JukeBox

###Description

Crowd-Sourced, YouTube-Powered Jukebox made with the Django Framework.

###Development
This is my first Web-Dev project, so documentation and testing are not keeping up with the state of the app. As I better learn the framework, I will bring the project more up to standards.

1. Clone repo
2. Start virtualenv
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
